            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas his Majesty in his Royall Person yesterday being the 4<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of <hi>January</hi> 1641. did come to the House of Commons attended with a great multitude of men armed in a warlike manner, with Holberts, Swords, and Pistolls, who came up to the very door of the House, and placed themselves there, and in other places and passages neer to the House, to the great terror and disturbance of the Members thereof, then sitting, and according to their duty, in a peaceable and orderly manner, treating of the great affairs of both Kingdoms of England and Ireland; And his Majesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed himself in the Speakers Chair, did demand the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of divers Members of the House to be delivered unto Him.</p>
            <p>It is this day declared by the House of Commons, that the same is a high breach of the Rights and Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inconsistent to the Liberty and freedome thereof: and therefore this House doth conceive they cannot with the safety of their own Persons, or the indempnity of the Rights and priviledges of Parliament, sit here any longer, without a full vindication of so high a breach, and a sufficient Guard wherein they may confide; for which both Houses joyntly, and this House by it self, have been humble Suitors to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and cannot as yet obtain.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which, this House being very sensible of the great trust reposed in them; and especially at this time of the manifold distractions of this Kingdome, and the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and distressed condition of the Kingdome of Ireland; doth Order, that this House shall be Adjourned untill Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb facs="tcp:125604:3"/> next at one of the Clock in the afternoon, and that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee be named by this House, and all that will come shall have voyces, shall sit at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in the City of London to morrow morning at nine of the clock, and shall have power to consider and resolve of all things that may concern the good and safety of the City and Kingdom, and particularly how our Priviledges may be vindicated, and our Persons secured. And to consider of the Affairs and relief of Ireland; and shall have power to consult and advise with any person or persons touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the premisses, and shall have power to send for parties, witnesses, papers, and Records.</p>
            <p>And it is further ordered, that the Committee for the Irish Affairs shall meet at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> aforesaid, at what time they shall think fit; and consult and do touching the Affairs of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, according to the power formerly given them by this House; and both the said Committees shall Report the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults of their consideration and Resolution to this House.</p>
